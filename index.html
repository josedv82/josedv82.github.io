            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-3">Technology and data don't make the difference. Decisions and implementation do.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-4">Avoiding hiring people who may be more skilled than you out of fear is much more detrimental in the long run.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-5">Perhaps, the most important analytical skill is understanding what data CANNOT tell you. Peter Weyand</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-6">When working with athletes, health is a requirement, not a goal.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-7">At certain times, prioritize growth and learning over a higher pay if you can. This paid dividends later for me.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-8">My biggest opportunities came from sports I didn't know well. What helped was staying critical, collaborate with those with more specific knowledge to adapt ideas, and leaving room to experiment.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-9">Work on your ability to communicate well-founded opinions to address current challenges.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-10">An easy win after joining a new organization is identifying ways to help others save time in their daily tasks.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-51">Don't overpromise. Deliver first, talk later. Show through actions, not words.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-11">Signs of good leadership: clear direction, empowerment, and quality feedback loops.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-12">Providing direction is mainly about defining the boundaries within which your team members can find possible solutions.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-13">Regarding direction, finding the balance between setting clear boundaries and allowing enough space for creativity is key to let new ideas to emerge.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-14">Oldie but goodie: Direction before speed.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-15">Master the 3Cs: code, coach, and communicate.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-16">Specialization got me into pro sports; general knowledge moved my career forward.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-17">Monitor less but more relevant aspects in order to accelerate learning.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-18">Assessments must be relevant, actionable, and integrated into training.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-19">The more complex the environment, the simpler the solution must be.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-52">Complexity kills adoption.The role of a sport scientist is to make things easier, not harder.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-20">Lifting heavy and often in-season is non-negotiable. Even the busiest schedules offer windows of opportunity.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-21">Trial and error, not just years, is the foundation for meaningful experience.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-22">Limited information is the norm in most high performance settings. Be good at explaining uncertainty.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-23">The main limitation in injury prediction is our ability to collect meaningful data.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-24">Athletes don't care about the rings on your shelf. They care about how you can help them today.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-25">Skill acquisition often comes second to other routine sports science tasks. Focus on building systems that streamline decision-making, freeing up time to work on higher ROI areas.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-26">Learning to interview is essential early in your career. Networking matters more after you've proven your value.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-28">When hiring, advertise job vacancies, even if you have candidates in mind. You never know what talent is out there.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-29">When someone asks about your philosophy, they want to know your values, beliefs and priorities as they will drive decisions and ensure consistency.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-30">Clearly explaining your philosophy matters more than being 'right'. Break concepts into smaller areas, document your beliefs, and revisit them often for clarity and direction.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-31">Focus on establishing good operational processes; talent, coaching and luck handle the rest.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-32">Arbitrary number but four years in one organization seems like the minimum time for someone to go through meaningful implementation, iteration, and learning.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-33">Good proof that your team is setting the standard is when your coaches become sought after by other organizations.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-34">The sports world is small. I once interviewed someone who had interviewed me six years earlier. Be kind; you never know when you'll cross paths again.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-35">Many problems we solved in sport have commercial value. Think bigger.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-36">Ask five people in your organization what 'Player X' has to improve. Lack of agreement signals opportunity.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-37">When people are overpaid relative to their value, every idea, opinion, and person becomes a threat to them.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-53">Being clear and direct earns more respect than being liked.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-38">Keep delaying those difficult conversations if you want to kill trust and allow small issues to grow.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-39">If an organization needs a Head of Innovation; it's probably not truly innovative.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-40">'Winning Culture' is an overhyped term. (Winning) culture is the consequence of people aligning with a purpose and finding personal value in the process.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-41">Better data at meaningful times outweights continuous monitoring.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-42">Practice design is often overlooked by sport scientists, yet it's one of the most impactful areas for coach and athlete development.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-43">Break performance into smaller, measurable components whenever possible. Athletes are more likely to buy in when they see clear, tangible links to their performance.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-44">Training theory and principles are ethernal. Courses and certifications are not.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-45">As a sport scientist, one of the most lasting things I can leave behind for an organization is good data. Not much else survives staff turnover.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-46">In many fields, especially sport science, it's better to be hyperskeptic at first.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-47">Exposing yourself to environments that require you to learn and adapt will do more for your growth than any paid mentorship.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-48">Affordable, reliable, and practical: you can pick two, but rarely all three.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-49">Talent adjusts through exposure and pressure, not just more training hours.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-50">Driving organisational change is hard. People may not know what they want, but they want what they know.</p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-54">Process compounds. In high performance and sport science, real impact takes time. Keep iterating. </p>
            <p class="quote-paragraph" id="quote-55">The difference between practitioners and consultants is someone who has been there and done it, not just someone who knows how to do it. Geoff McGrath</p>
